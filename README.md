### üåü My AI Journey: A Recent Milestone

After weeks of learning, building, and experimenting, I've successfully completed the **Google Gen AI Exchange Program** in collaboration with Hack2Skill and Google Cloud! This journey earned me **5 Skill Badges** in Generative AI, prompt engineering, and AI application development.

**What I Accomplished:**
1.  **Prompt Design in Vertex AI:** Gained skills in prompt engineering and multimodal generative techniques using Gemini models for real-world marketing scenarios.
2.  **Build Real World AI Applications with Gemini and Imagen:** Worked on image recognition, NLP, and image generation with Gemini & Imagen, and deployed AI applications on Vertex AI.
3.  **Develop GenAI Apps with Gemini and Streamlit:** Built AI-powered apps with text generation, function calling, and deployed using Streamlit + Cloud Run.
4.  **Inspect Rich Documents with Gemini Multimodality and Multimodal RAG:** Used multimodal prompts for extracting insights from text, images, and video, and implemented Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
5.  **Explore Generative AI with the Gemini API in Vertex AI:** Explored advanced text, image, and video analysis, multimodal content generation, and function calling techniques.

This program gave me hands-on experience with Google Cloud's powerful AI ecosystem to design, build, and deploy AI solutions for real-world use cases. A big thanks to [Hack2Skill](https://hack2skill.com/) and [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) for this incredible learning experience! ‚ú®
