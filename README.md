## üåü My AI Journey: A Recent Milestone

<div class="ai-milestone">
  <p>After weeks of learning, building, and experimenting, I've successfully completed the <strong>Google Gen AI Exchange Program</strong> in collaboration with Hack2Skill and Google Cloud! This journey earned me <strong>5 Skill Badges</strong> in Generative AI, prompt engineering, and AI application development.</p>

  <h3>What I Accomplished:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Prompt Design in Vertex AI:</strong>
      Gained skills in prompt engineering, image analysis, and multimodal generative techniques using Gemini models for real-world marketing scenarios.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Build Real World AI Applications with Gemini and Imagen:</strong>
      Worked on image recognition, NLP, and image generation with Gemini & Imagen, and deployed AI applications on Vertex AI.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Develop GenAI Apps with Gemini and Streamlit:</strong>
      Built AI-powered apps with text generation, function calling (Python SDK & Gemini API), and deployed using Streamlit + Cloud Run.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Inspect Rich Documents with Gemini Multimodality and Multimodal RAG:</strong>
      Used multimodal prompts for extracting insights from text, images, and video, and implemented Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for advanced document analysis.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Explore Generative AI with the Gemini API in Vertex AI:</strong>
      Explored advanced text, image, and video analysis, multimodal content generation, and function calling techniques to expand AI project capabilities.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>This program gave me hands-on experience with Google Cloud's powerful AI ecosystem and taught me how to design, build, and deploy AI solutions for real-world use cases. A big thanks to <a href="https://hack2skill.com/" target="_blank">Hack2Skill</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Cloud</a> for making this incredible learning experience possible! ‚ú®</p>
